This folder contains tree structure, phenotype recnstruction, genotype reconstruction and simultaneous scores produced by treeWAS
You need to go to branch data2 to see right data (in folder "data") and right plots (in folder "plots"). Converting matrix with gene prescence/absence to genind format lead to data loss, and we used not-converted matrix for second treeWAS launch. However, our conclusions stay the same.
